## 🚀 Quick Start: Adding a LeetCode Solution

### Using the Automated Script

The easiest way to add a new LeetCode solution is using the provided script:

```bash
# Navigate to repository root
cd /path/to/DSA

# Add a new solution
./scripts/add-leetcode-solution.sh -n <number> -t "<title>" -d <difficulty> -l <language>
```

**Example:**
```bash
# Add "Two Sum" in Python
./scripts/add-leetcode-solution.sh -n 1 -t "Two Sum" -d Easy -l python -g "Array,Hash Table"

# Add and auto-commit
./scripts/add-leetcode-solution.sh -n 15 -t "3Sum" -d Medium -l java -g "Array,Two Pointers" -c

# Add, commit, and push
./scripts/add-leetcode-solution.sh -n 4 -t "Median of Two Sorted Arrays" -d Hard -l cpp -p
```

### Script Options

| Option | Description | Required | Default |
|--------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `-n, --number` | Problem number | Yes | - |
| `-t, --title` | Problem title | Yes | - |
| `-d, --difficulty` | Easy, Medium, or Hard | Yes | - |
| `-l, --language` | python, java, cpp, js | No | python |
| `-s, --slug` | URL slug | No | Auto-generated |
| `-g, --tags` | Comma-separated tags | No | TODO |
| `-c, --commit` | Auto-commit changes | No | false |
| `-p, --push` | Auto-commit and push | No | false |
| `-h, --help` | Display help | No | - |

### Supported Languages

- **Python** (.py) - Default
- **Java** (.java)
- **C++** (.cpp)
- **JavaScript** (.js)

---

## 📊 LeetCode Statistics

<!-- These statistics can be automatically updated by GitHub Actions -->

### Current Progress

| Difficulty | Count |
|------------|-------|
| 🟢 Easy | 0 |
| 🟡 Medium | 0 |
| 🔴 Hard | 0 |
| **Total** | **0** |

> Run the GitHub Actions workflow or use `find LeetCode/{Easy,Medium,Hard} -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d | wc -l` to update counts.

---

## 📝 Workflow

### 1. Solve on LeetCode
- Go to [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- Solve the problem
- Test with multiple test cases

### 2. Add to Repository
```bash
./scripts/add-leetcode-solution.sh \
  -n <problem_number> \
  -t "<Problem Title>" \
  -d <Easy|Medium|Hard> \
  -l <language> \
  -g "Tag1,Tag2"
```

### 3. Implement Solution
The script creates:
- `LeetCode/{Difficulty}/{number}-{slug}/solution.{ext}`
- `LeetCode/{Difficulty}/{number}-{slug}/README.md`

Edit these files with your solution and documentation.

### 4. Complete Documentation
Fill in the README.md with:
- Problem description (copy from LeetCode)
- Your approach and algorithm
- Complexity analysis
- Test cases
- Notes and related problems

### 5. Commit and Push
```bash
git add LeetCode/
git commit -m "Add LeetCode #<number>: <Title> (<Difficulty>)"
git push
```

Or use the `-p` flag with the script to do this automatically!
